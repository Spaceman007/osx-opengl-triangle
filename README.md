# Draw a triangle on OSX.

First and for most, install tools or packages below:
- **XCode**, this one must be installed.
- glfw, `$ brew install glfw`
- glew, `$ brew install glew`
- cmake, we use it to build this project.

Once you have installed *Xcode*, *glew*, *glfw*, *cmake*, JUST run cmake:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Then you'll have the Executable **Jupiter**, just run:
```bash
$ ./Jupiter
```
And you'll see a white triangle in the window.

Since you have this basic development environment, just go on with OpenGL and do anything you want.
